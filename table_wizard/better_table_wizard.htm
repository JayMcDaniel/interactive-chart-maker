<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>This wizard looks for new lines between rows and tabs between cells and should work with data copied from Excel cells. Make sure that you only copied exactly what you wanted to show. There may be errors and you may see "undefined" if the cell quantities don't make sense. <b>Internet Explorer needs "&amp;nbsp;" or a space in your blank cells, and your columns must have headers.</b></p>
<p>If there are trailing commas at the end of your table title or any cell, check that you don't have extra tabs after them in your input text.</p>
<p>To indent row headers, add two spaces at a time.</p>
<p>Footnotes should be entered as [1] or [p] and so on. </p>
<p>The bottom footnotes brackets need a space between them and the following text. Cell footnotes in the left column should come after the text with no trailing spaces.</p>
<p>If your bottom footnotes or last row isn't appearing, try inserting a return after the last line of your box data. If your footnotes are being included as normal table text, you might have an extra return after the end of your data.</p>
<p>If you see an extra row or column, make sure there's not extra returns or tabs in your data.</p>
<br>
<h4>Headers spanning multiple columns:</h4>
<p> If you are using a new browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE9+), merge your column headers to span their columns in excell:</p>
<img src="images/table_example1.png">

<p> If you are using an older browser (IE8 and below), you must instead put "&amp;nbsp;" in the column heads to the right or beneath the column heads you want them to merge with. This formatting will also work for the new browsers:</p>
<img src="images/table_example2.png">


<br>


<p>The table wizard will allow an unlimited amount of column header rows. For it to work, the headers must be set up in a logical descending order with sub column heads filled in (If this doesn't fit your chart type, it’s possible to make the table and edit later). Cells with only a &quot;^&quot; (without the quote marks) in them, will be merged up. See example:</p>
<img src="images/multi-head-example.png">
<br>
<br>


<h3 id=sortableTableNote>Sortable Table Note</h3>
<p> If you use sortable tables, be aware that this table maker is in BETA phase, and be sure to test its functionality carefully. <a href="http://dewsnet/documentation/styleguide/BLS_Website_Style_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">Documentation can be found here.</a></p>

<p>It will initially sort by the first column. See <a href="http://datatables.net/index">http://datatables.net/index</a> to see how to customize your table</p>
<p>In addition to the table code, you will need to have the following script links on your page, preferably in the head section</p>
<code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.bls.gov/javascripts/jquery.dataTables.min.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt; <br>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.bls.gov/javascripts/sortable_datatable.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt; <br>
&lt;link href="http://www.bls.gov/stylesheets/datatable.css" media="all" rel="Stylesheet" type="text/css"/&gt;


</code>
<br><p>You will also need include the styles in your page head from <a href="/chart_maker/table_wizard/sortable-table-styles.css">sortable-table-styles.css </a>. This will correct some styling issues and make it look more in line with BLS style.
<h3>Text Tabulation Tables</h3>
<p>If you check the text tabulation box, it will make a blank table without headers or footers or styling. Your Excel spreadsheet should look simular to this:</p>
<p><img src="images/text-tabs-example.jpg" width="453" height="130"></p>
<p>Your result should look like this: </p>
<p><img src="images/text-tabs-example-result.jpg" width="588" height="103"><br></p>

<h3 id ="mergingCellsInfo">Merging Cells after the table is made</h3>
<p>To merge cells after the table is made, click one cell, then click another. The higher or leftmost cell will be merged over the other. </p>
